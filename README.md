## What is `react-twemoji-components`?

`react-twemoji-components` is a package which exposes a component for each emoji in the Twemoji set. This is useful when you want to use Twemoji as an Icon set. If you want to use Emojis primarily in text, you should use a different package like [react-twemoji](https://github.com/zxmys/react-twemoji) or [react-emoji-render](https://github.com/tommoor/react-emoji-render)

## Current status (‚ö†Ô∏è)

`react-twemoji-components` hasn't been battle-tested yet and is in pre-release state. However, due to the simple nature of the package, you should be able to use it in production if you can live with the limitations listed below.

- The dataset we're using is currently stuck on Unicode 13.0. We're working on updating it to Unicode 14.0/15.0. You can still use these emojis, but their name will be their codepoint. These are however deprecated and may be removed in any future update.
- Some emojis are missing from the dataset. These include for example the letters or digits.
- The skin tone variants are currently executed as seperate components. These will be removed in the future and replaced with a single component which takes a `skinTone` prop.
- The package currently still uses Twitter's Twemoji set. We're working on switching to the new fork by jdecked.
